In this section, we validate the operational observability of our Serverless backend architecture using **Amazon CloudWatch**, focusing on **CloudWatch Logs** and **CloudWatch Metrics / Alarms**.

---

#### 1. Verifying Execution Traces on CloudWatch Logs

* **Execution Steps:**
  1. Open **Amazon CloudWatch Console** -> Select **Log groups**.
  2. Select the Log Group dedicated to backend Lambda functions and inspect the latest Log Stream.

* **Expected Results:**
  * CloudWatch records the complete execution trace: `START RequestId`, `REPORT Duration`, `Billed Duration`, `Memory Size`.

#### 2. Inspecting Operational Metrics

* **Execution Steps:**
  1. Access CloudWatch Console -> **Metrics** -> Select **Lambda** / **API Gateway**.
  2. Observe real-time indicators: **Invocations**, **Duration**, **Error Count**.

* **Expected Results:**
  * Graphs reflect real-time request traffic accurately with 100% success rate.
